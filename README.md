# LPL Super Pony Up

An Android application that displays a list of comments from a JSON API with profile image customization functionality.

## Project Overview

This Android application demonstrates modern Android development practices through a simple interface that displays comments from a JSON API. Users can customize profile images by tapping on the profile placeholder icons to select images from their device's photo gallery.

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Pattern**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture
- **UI Framework**: Built with Jetpack Compose for a modern, declarative UI
- **State Management**: Kotlin Flow for reactive state updates
- **Dependency Injection**: Hilt for clean and testable dependency injection
- **Navigation**: Jetpack Navigation Compose for screen navigation
- **Build Variants**: Supports 'mock' and 'prod' flavors for development and production environments

### Data Layer
- **API Client**: Retrofit for network requests
- **Endpoint**: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments
- **Local Storage**: Room DB for offline caching of comments
- **Repository Pattern**: Single source of truth for data operations

### Features
- Display list of comments with profile images
- Replace profile placeholder images with photos from gallery
- Support for both landscape and portrait orientations
- Error handling with retry functionality
- Network connectivity awareness with offline support
- Responsive design that prevents text truncation

### Testing
- **UI Tests**: Compose UI testing with ComposeTestRule
  - Tests for loading, success, error, and initial states
  - Component rendering verification
- **Unit Tests**: Repository implementation tests with mock data
- **Mock Data**: JSON mock data for offline testing

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains models, repository implementation, local and remote data sources
- **di**: Dependency injection modules
- **ui**: Compose UI screens, components, and themes
- **util**: Utility classes and extensions

## Build and Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Select either the 'mock' or 'prod' build variant
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device

## Future Enhancements
- Splash screen implementation
- Custom app icon design
- More specific error messages based on HTTP status codes
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Extended test coverage
- Support for larger screen sizes (tablets)

## Original request:

Implement Java and MVVM architecture-based project to achieve below features.
Use all jetpack components that you can use here.

1. Build a screen as shown below with json data mapping
   ![img.png](Images/img.png)
2. Consume below web service to build the screen (Use retrofit library)
   https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments

3. Currently in the service we donâ€™t have an attribute to show the profile image, default show the
   place holder icon as shown
4. Provide the action on profile place holder icon to replace with new icon from photo gallery
5. App should be universal app, will work on landscape and portrait mode
6. Make sure any text shown on screen should not truncate
7. Any suggestion on current UI design are most welcome
8. When completed, please upload to GIT HUB and be prepared to not only walk through the code but
   demo the project.
