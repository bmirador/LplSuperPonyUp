Implement Java and MVVM architecture-based project to achieve below features.
Use all jetpack components that you can use here.

1. Build a screen as shown below with json data mapping
   ![img.png](Images/img.png)
2. Consume below web service to build the screen (Use retrofit library)
   https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1/comments

3. Currently in the service we donâ€™t have an attribute to show the profile image, default show the
   place holder icon as shown
4. Provide the action on profile place holder icon to replace with new icon from photo gallery
5. App should be universal app, will work on landscape and portrait mode
6. Make sure any text shown on screen should not truncate
7. Any suggestion on current UI design are most welcome
8. When completed, please upload to GIT HUB and be prepared to not only walk through the code but
   demo the project.

Outstanding items:
Sadly, I'm sleepy and I was told to get the code done the same day it was given to me
so here are some of the features I would had introduce if given more time in no specific order:
Room, splash screen, icon, specific error messages depending on http codes or exceptions, ADA,
extend testing,comments.

Will update with another commit, I hope to make it in time, if not, well, it is what it is.
